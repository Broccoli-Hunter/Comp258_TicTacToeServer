# Comp258_TicTacToeServer
Tic Tac Toe game implmented on a server

Final Project for Comp258/Object Oriented Software Development
* March 2022
* Grade = 99%

Note: Students were provided with a very basic Echo Server architecture to begin with, then added additional functionality to turn it into a chat client(selecting ports other than default, having a username, ability to chat with other users, various chat rooms and chat room commands, private messaging, admin functions on the server side, and a GUI for the client side) through assignments with assistance as needed. For the final project, students could choose one of three options with increasing difficulty to earn up to a maximum of 100% of the project grade. Each option started with the server we worked on in class, and Tic Tac Toe was the most difficult option.

### Objective
* Create a Tic Tac Toe option to add into the chat client so two players can see and play from a Tic Tac Toe interface
* Tic Tac Toe board state is passed back and forth from player 1 to server to player 2, and local board state is updated each turn
